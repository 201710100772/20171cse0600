<p style="color:#36C;">An old man lived in the village. He was one of the most unfortunate people in the world. The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood.</p>


<p style="letter-spacing:2em">The longer he lived, the more bile he was becoming and the more poisonous were his words. People avoided him, because his misfortune became contagious</p>


<p style="font-size:24pt">It was even unnatural and insulting to be happy next to him.</p>


<p style="line-height:3ex">But one day, when he turned eighty years old, an incredible thing happened.</p> 


<p style="word-spacing:15mm">Instantly everyone started hearing the rumour:</p>


<div style="margin-bottom:10px;">
<p>The whole village was tired of him; he was always gloomy, he constantly complained and was always in a bad mood.</p>
